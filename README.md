# .Avi-Stormgate-maps
.Avi's Stormgate maps and related files, with the map folders and other things such as terrain files (or folders)

## Branch Guide
If you're looking for a specific version of a map I made for a replay, or for some other reason, and are struggling to find it, follow this guide to help find it.
### Main
Any files here are release files. If you played a version of a map released to the discord, it can probably be found here.
### Development
Any files here are other files. If I (.Avi) hosted a map, usually for testing purposes, and it *isn't* a version you can download off the discord or in any version/commit of the Main branch, it should be here.
